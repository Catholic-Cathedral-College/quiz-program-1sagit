Guilt eats at you as you glance around at your worn, traumatised classmates as the sheer amount of death and gore you just had to face in the last hour or so. Considering how fresh the infection is you doubt there's been a vaccine or any defensive mechanism. You can feel your mind fogging and your mouth starting to water as the heli cabin start smelling like a delicious meal. You've worked hard too and you've come all this way. You're landing in the military base now. You lunge. And as you claw through the soldier's body, devouring each piece amidst the chaos you started, you faintly hope that your friends would understand.",
  "good": "You are shaking. Usually someone would spare you a concerned glance but you and your classmates have been through too much individually to think about others currently. You look at these faces around you which have had to make horrific decisions and witness traumatising things. They desreve to finally have a good rest. Your gaze floats over to the open helicopter door. Considering how fresh and infectious this disease is you doubt there're any proper procedures like quarantine in place. You stand up, one of the soldiers open his mouth but before he says anything you pull up your shirt, showcasing the scratch starting from your hip bone to your belly button. Your friend's eyes widen and they all scramble out of their seats and reac for you but it's too late. You are falling through the door and into nothing but air. There's something freeing about it. You feel peace."
